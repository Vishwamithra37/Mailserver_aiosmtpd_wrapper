So, You wanted to make a mail server in python? Great. You are at the right place!

**A brief intro to SMTP:**
<ol>
<li>
 <b>SMTP</b>- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, has <b>only one job to do. That is to pass the email from the one device to another device. This can be from user to server or server to server. </b>
  
</li>
  <li>
   <b> A Mail server </b>is nothing but a place where Mails reside. That is, Mails come and sit there from various sources (Other email servers). The Mail server is simply responsible for handling security handshakes and to-from verifications of the email.
